          Each year since 2012, glass floats made by artists Eben Horton,
          Jennifer Nauck and the glassblowers at
          <a

            >The Glass Station Studio and Gallery</a

          in Wakefield, Rhode Island have been hidden on Block Island as part of
          the
          <a href="https://www.blockislandinfo.com/glass-float-project"
            >Block Island Glass Floats project</a
          >. Each float is individually numbered and dated. Most of these floats
          are made from clear glass, but each year the first several glass
          floats (same as the number of years after 2000, so for 2023 there will
          be 23) are extra fancy floats with bright colors and decorations.
          Anyone who finds a glass float is asked to register the year and
          number on their float and where on the island they found it. This
          interactive map uses
          <a

            >that information </a
          >to show where the regular and fancy floats have been found on the
          island each year, and how many have been found in each area.
